## Overview
We have our phone number and we have our Contact Flow... now it's time to join the two together and tell Connect that whenever our phone number is dialed, it should use our new Contact Flow.

## Routing our calls

1. First things first, we need to  open the <b>"Phone Numbers"</b> page which can be found in the <b>"Routing"</b> menu.
