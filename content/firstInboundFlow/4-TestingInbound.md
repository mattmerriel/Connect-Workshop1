We have now provisioned our <b>1800 XXX XXX</b> number, built a simple Contact Flow and connected the two together. It is now time that we can ring the number and make sure that everything is working correctly.

Simply Use your mobile phone (or softphone) to dial your number and you should hear the text you used back in the <b>Something</b> section of the <b>Something Else</b> part of this chapter.

## Next Steps
Assuming all has gone well (And feel free to raise your hand and ask for help if it didn't) you are ready to move into the next section where we will make our Contact Flow do a little more than just talk to us. To continue click the <b>"Adding Interactivitiy"</b> section below or on the sidebar to the left.
