## Overview
Up until now our contact centre hasn't actually done much other than provide a menu for our callers and play back some text-to-speech prompts and this can hardly be called a contact centre. In this section we will take a look at what's involved in getting an agent online that can answer inbound calls and respond to user queries.

Firstly we will need to tweak our existing Contact Flow and then create a new Contact Centre Agent and configure then to be able to use the CCP.
