## Overview
Time for us to apply the new Contact Flow to our pre-existing Toll-Free phone number, much like we did in the previous part of the workshop.

## Routing our calls

1. First things first, we need to  open the <b>"Phone Numbers"</b> page which can be found in the <b>"Routing"</b> menu.

Here we can see that we are presented with several settings we can change including the Description as well as the "Contact flow / IVR" that's being used.

3. Here we can select the Contact Flow/IVR that it's using. From the drop-down list, select <b>"Main Incoming"</b> (or whatever you called it).

With our new Contact Flow in place it's time for us to move onto the next phase and test our IVR.
